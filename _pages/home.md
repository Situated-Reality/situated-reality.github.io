### About the Lab

Welcome to the **Situated Reality Lab**, where we explore the frontiers of interactive technologies grounded in the richness of human experience and real-world contexts.

Our research lies at the intersection of **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, **Mixed Reality (MR)**, and **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**. We investigate how technology can be meaningfully embedded in the world around us, supporting new forms of interaction, perception, and collaboration.

## Research Themes

Our lab is currently focused on but not limited to the following directions:

### ðŸ”¹ Body-Centric Interfaces
We design and study **body-centric interfaces** that **augment human** capabilities through **embodied interaction** in **mixed reality** environments. By leveraging the body as an expressive, perceptual, and interactive medium, we aim to create interfaces that are intuitive, empowering, and deeply human.

### ðŸ”¹ AI-Driven Context Awareness
We explore how **AI-driven context awareness** can enable **adaptive user interfaces** in **ubiquitous MR**. Our goal is to facilitate **seamless situated interaction** in **everyday** environmentsâ€”also referred to as **spatial computing**â€”by sensing and responding to users' contexts, activities, and intentions.

Whether you're interested in embodied design, ubiquitous computing, spatial interaction, or AI-powered XR systems, we welcome collaboration and conversation.

> Situated reality is not just about technologyâ€”it's about people, place, and the powerful interactions in between.
